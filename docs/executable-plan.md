# Windows Executable Plan — SCS2 Session Visualizer

This document specifies a multi-stage plan to produce a Windows executable
distribution of the SCS2 Session Visualizer JFX application using the standard
JDK tooling (`jpackage` and `jlink`). It follows the same project structure
and packaging philosophy as the existing Debian flow (`buildDebianPackage`
task in `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/build.gradle.kts`).

## Decisions (locked in)

| Topic | Choice |
|---|---|
| Plan document | Single file `docs/executable-plan.md` |
| Deliverables | (a) Portable `app-image` folder, (b) `.msi` installer (WiX 3.x) |
| Launchers | Both `SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe` and `MCAPRepackApplication.exe` |
| Stage 1 status | Stage 2 (`jlink`-trimmed runtime) is the **default release path**. Stage 1 is retained as a fallback that does not require the JavaFX jmods download. |
| Build integration | New Gradle tasks added to `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/build.gradle.kts` (mirroring `buildDebianPackage`) |
| CI | Local-only in this plan; CI integration listed as a follow-up |
| Icon | Pre-generated `scs-icon.ico` committed alongside existing PNG/SVG |
| Installer version string | `0.32.1` (project version `17-0.32.1` with the `17-` Java-baseline prefix stripped — MSI only honours the first 3 numeric fields, so the 4th-field convention `17.0.32.1` would alias every patch release to the same upgrade-detection value) |
| Default heap | `-Xmx8g` |
| Code signing | Out of scope; listed as a follow-up |

## Stage overview

| Stage | Goal | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Prerequisites and one-time setup on the build machine | Tooling installed, icon committed |
| 1 | Build a Windows distribution with a bundled full JRE using `jpackage` | `app-image` directory (432 MB on disk) + `.msi` installer (347 MB compressed) |
| 2 | Replace the bundled full JRE with a trimmed runtime built by `jlink` | Same artifacts, 368 MB on disk + 340 MB MSI (measured on 2026-05-24; see §2.8). The on-disk JRE shrinks from 119 MB to 55 MB; the MSI gain is modest because most of the installer is already-compressed jars dominated by the OpenCV GPU classifier at 132 MB. |
| 3 | Promote both stages into reproducible Gradle tasks | `packageWindowsAppImage`, `packageWindowsMsi`, `buildJlinkRuntime`, `packageWindowsAppImageJlink`, `packageWindowsMsiJlink`, `buildWindowsPackages`, `buildWindowsPackagesJlink` |

Each stage is independently runnable. Stage 1 must work end-to-end before
Stage 2 is attempted.

---

## Stage 0 — Prerequisites (one-time)

### 0.1 Build-machine software

Install on the Windows build machine (any developer who will run the
packaging):

1. **JDK 17** (Temurin 17 LTS recommended). Must include `jpackage` and
   `jlink` on the `bin/` folder. Verify:
   ```bat
   java -version
   jpackage --version
   jlink --version
   ```
   Set `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK 17 install root.

   Note: the JetBrains Runtime (JBR, used by IntelliJ as
   `C:\Program Files\JetBrains\…\jbr`) is **not** sufficient — it ships
   without `jpackage` or `jlink`. If `JAVA_HOME` points at a JBR, point
   it at a full JDK 17 install for packaging.

2. **WiX Toolset 3.x** (3.11 or 3.14 — *not* 4.x; `jpackage` only supports
   the v3 series). Download from
   <https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases>. Install and add the
   install directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\bin`) to
   `PATH`. Verify:
   ```bat
   candle.exe -?
   light.exe -?
   ```
   WiX is only required for `.msi` output; the portable `app-image` does
   not need it.

3. **JavaFX 17.0.8 jmods** (only required starting in Stage 2 — skip for
   Stage 1). Download
   `openjfx-17.0.8_windows-x64_bin-jmods.zip` from
   <https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/> (matches the version pinned in
   `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/build.gradle.kts`). Unzip somewhere
   stable, e.g. `C:\javafx-jmods-17.0.8`. Do **not** commit this to the
   repo — record the path as an environment variable (`JAVAFX_JMODS_DIR`)
   for Stage 2.

### 0.2 Icon artifact

`jpackage` on Windows requires a `.ico` file; the repo currently only
contains `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/src/main/resources/icons/scs-icon.png`
and `scs-icon.svg`.

1. Convert `scs-icon.png` (or `scs-icon.svg`) to a multi-resolution
   `scs-icon.ico` containing the 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, and 256 pixel
   variants. One-off using ImageMagick:
   ```bat
   magick scs-icon.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 scs-icon.ico
   ```
   Or use an online converter; the only requirement is that it is a valid
   multi-resolution Windows `.ico`.

2. Commit the file at
   `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/src/main/resources/icons/scs-icon.ico`
   alongside the existing `scs-icon.png` and `scs-icon.svg`. It is not
   loaded by JavaFX (which uses the PNG via `SCS_ICON_IMAGE` in
   `SessionVisualizerIOTools`), so committing it does not affect runtime
   behaviour.

### 0.3 Verify the inputs

Before continuing to Stage 1, run:

```bat
gradlew.bat :scs2-session-visualizer-jfx:installDist
```

This must produce
`scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\install\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\`
containing `bin\` (with the existing `.bat` launchers) and `lib\` (with
all classpath jars). Confirm the main jar exists:

```
scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\install\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\lib\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar
```

If the filename differs (e.g. version bumped), use the actual name in the
`--main-jar` argument throughout the rest of this plan.

### 0.4 Reference values used throughout the plan

| Symbol | Value |
|---|---|
| Project version (Gradle) | `17-0.32.1` (from `group.gradle.properties`) |
| Installer version | `0.32.1` (strip the `17-` Java-baseline prefix; MSI only honours the first 3 numeric fields and would alias `17.0.32.1`, `17.0.32.2`, … to the same upgrade-detection value) |
| Vendor | `IHMC` |
| Application name | `SCS2SessionVisualizer` |
| Main class (GUI) | `us.ihmc.scs2.sessionVisualizer.jfx.SessionVisualizer` |
| Main class (MCAP) | `us.ihmc.scs2.sessionVisualizer.jfx.session.mcap.MCAPRepackApplication` |
| Main jar | `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar` |
| Icon | `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/src/main/resources/icons/scs-icon.ico` |
| `installDist` output | `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/build/install/scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/` |
| Packaging output root | `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/deployment/windows/` |

---

## Stage 1 — `jpackage` with bundled full JRE

Goal: produce a working Windows distribution using only `jpackage` and the
existing `installDist` output. The resulting app bundles a full JDK 17
runtime image; size is the trade-off for simplicity.

### 1.1 Strategy

The classpath jars in `build/install/scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/lib/` are
exactly what `jpackage` needs as `--input`. The JDK that runs `jpackage`
becomes the runtime image embedded in the bundle (this is the default
when `--runtime-image` is not specified). The two launchers
(`SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe` and `MCAPRepackApplication.exe`) are emitted
via the primary `--name` plus `--add-launcher`.

The GUI launcher should not show a console window (default behaviour).
The MCAP launcher *should* show a console window because
`MCAPRepackApplication` is a CLI tool that uses `commons-cli`, prints
help via `HelpFormatter`, writes progress to `stderr` via
`me.tongfei:progressbar`, and uses `System.exit(...)`. This is controlled
per-launcher via the `win-console=true` line in the add-launcher
properties file.

### 1.2 Inputs required

1. `installDist` has been run (Stage 0.3).
2. `scs-icon.ico` is committed (Stage 0.2).
3. `JAVA_HOME` points at a JDK 17.
4. WiX 3.x is on `PATH` (for `.msi` output).

### 1.3 Launcher properties file

Create the secondary launcher's property file under
`scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/deployment/windows/launchers/`.

Note: `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/.gitignore` excludes `deployment/`,
mirroring the existing Debian flow whose `deployment/debian/` tree is
also generated at build time and not committed. The Gradle task in
Stage 3 therefore *materialises* this file at task execution time; in
the manual-flow case below the file is created by hand and is not
checked in.

**`MCAPRepackApplication.properties`**:

```properties
main-jar=scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar
main-class=us.ihmc.scs2.sessionVisualizer.jfx.session.mcap.MCAPRepackApplication
win-console=true
icon=scs-icon.ico
java-options=-Dprism.vsync=false
java-options=-Xmx2g
```

Notes:
- `win-console=true` attaches a console window so users see CLI help and
  progress bars.
- Heap is smaller here (`-Xmx2g`) because the MCAP tool does not need
  the GUI's allocation.
- The primary GUI launcher does not need its own properties file; its
  settings come from the top-level `jpackage` arguments.

### 1.4 `jpackage` invocations

All commands below are run from the repository root.

#### 1.4.1 Portable `app-image` (deliverable A)

```bat
jpackage ^
  --type app-image ^
  --name SCS2SessionVisualizer ^
  --app-version 0.32.1 ^
  --vendor "IHMC" ^
  --description "Simulation Construction Set 2 - Session Visualizer" ^
  --copyright "IHMC" ^
  --input  scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\install\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\lib ^
  --dest   scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\app-image ^
  --main-jar scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar ^
  --main-class us.ihmc.scs2.sessionVisualizer.jfx.SessionVisualizer ^
  --icon scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\src\main\resources\icons\scs-icon.ico ^
  --java-options "-Dprism.vsync=false" ^
  --java-options "-Xmx8g" ^
  --add-launcher MCAPRepackApplication=scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\launchers\MCAPRepackApplication.properties
```

Result:
`scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\app-image\SCS2SessionVisualizer\`
containing `SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe`, `MCAPRepackApplication.exe`,
`runtime\` (bundled JRE), and `app\` (the classpath jars). Distribute
as a zip.

#### 1.4.2 `.msi` installer (deliverable B)

```bat
jpackage ^
  --type msi ^
  --name SCS2SessionVisualizer ^
  --app-version 0.32.1 ^
  --vendor "IHMC" ^
  --description "Simulation Construction Set 2 - Session Visualizer" ^
  --copyright "IHMC" ^
  --input  scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\install\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\lib ^
  --dest   scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\msi ^
  --main-jar scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar ^
  --main-class us.ihmc.scs2.sessionVisualizer.jfx.SessionVisualizer ^
  --icon scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\src\main\resources\icons\scs-icon.ico ^
  --java-options "-Dprism.vsync=false" ^
  --java-options "-Xmx8g" ^
  --add-launcher MCAPRepackApplication=scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\launchers\MCAPRepackApplication.properties ^
  --win-dir-chooser ^
  --win-menu ^
  --win-menu-group "SCS2" ^
  --win-shortcut ^
  --win-upgrade-uuid f74c546b-1d1d-4114-9812-809b8eb1412c
```

Result:
`scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\msi\SCS2SessionVisualizer-0.32.1.msi`

Notes on the WiX-specific options:
- `--win-dir-chooser` lets the user pick install location (defaults
  otherwise to `C:\Program Files\SCS2SessionVisualizer\`).
- `--win-menu` + `--win-menu-group "SCS2"` creates Start Menu entries
  under an "SCS2" group.
- `--win-shortcut` adds a desktop shortcut.
- `--win-upgrade-uuid` is a **stable** UUID identifying this product
  across versions; future installers with the same UUID and a higher
  `--app-version` upgrade in place rather than install side-by-side.
  The product's canonical value is
  `f74c546b-1d1d-4114-9812-809b8eb1412c`. **Do not change it between
  releases.**

### 1.5 Stage 1 validation checklist

After running each invocation, perform these checks before declaring the
stage complete:

1. **Launch the GUI**: double-click
   `app-image\SCS2SessionVisualizer\SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe`. No console
   window should appear. The main window opens with the title
   "No Active Session" and the SCS icon in the title bar.
2. **Open a session**: load a small known-good session (e.g. a recorded
   MCAP log or a YoVariable log directory). Verify the YoVariable
   sidebar populates and the 3D view renders.
3. **Test the YoGraphic editor**: open the YoGraphic property editor
   and confirm the type dropdown is populated. This exercises the
   `org.reflections` runtime scan in `YoGraphicFXControllerTools` against
   the packaged classpath — if it returns an empty list, packaging is
   wrong.
4. **Test the MCAP launcher** from `cmd.exe`:
   ```bat
   "%LOCALAPPDATA%\SCS2SessionVisualizer\MCAPRepackApplication.exe" --help
   ```
   The help text from `HelpFormatter` should print to the attached
   console. Without `--help`, the file chooser should open.
5. **Install the MSI**: double-click the produced `.msi`. Verify Start
   Menu entries are created under "SCS2", desktop shortcut works, and
   the app launches from each entry.
6. **Uninstall**: confirm uninstall via Settings → Apps removes all
   files except user data under `%USERPROFILE%\.ihmc\`.
7. **Reinstall over upgrade**: bump `--app-version` to a higher number,
   keep the same `--win-upgrade-uuid`, and install again. The previous
   version should be replaced, not installed alongside.

### 1.6 Stage 1 troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `Error: Bundler "MSI Installer" (msi) failed to produce a bundle.` | WiX 3.x not on `PATH`. Add `C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\bin` and reopen the shell. |
| `Error: Invalid Option: [--win-upgrade-uuid]` | Using WiX 4.x instead of 3.x. Downgrade WiX. |
| `Error: Version [17-0.32.1] contains invalid component` | Forgot to strip the `17-` Java-baseline prefix from `--app-version`. Use `0.32.1`. |
| App launches then closes silently | Run from `cmd.exe` to see the exit code; usually a missing native library (Stage 0.3 did not pick up the Windows-classifier jars — make sure `installDistLinux` was *not* run). |
| YoGraphic dropdown is empty | `org.reflections` cannot see the application jars. Ensure all jars from `lib/` were copied into `--input` (the default behaviour) and no security sandboxing is blocking `getResources()`. |
| `JavaFX runtime components are missing` error | A non-modular invocation problem: confirm `--main-class` points at a class that does **not** extend `javafx.application.Application` directly (this codebase's `SessionVisualizer` is a regular class — correct). |
| Console window flashes on GUI launcher | Don't pass `--win-console` to the primary launcher; it is unset by default. |
| No console on MCAP launcher | The `MCAPRepackApplication.properties` file is missing `win-console=true`, or the file path passed to `--add-launcher` is wrong. |

### 1.7 Stage 1 smoke-test outcome (2026-05-24)

The Stage 1 `app-image` flow was exercised manually on this machine
before the Gradle integration in Stage 3 was written.

Deviations from the spec used during the smoke test:
- Packaging JDK was OpenJDK 25.0.2 (the only JDK with `jpackage` on the
  machine), not the plan-target JDK 17. The bundled runtime was
  therefore JDK 25.
- `--type msi` was skipped (WiX 3.x was not installed).
- Only the primary `SCS2SessionVisualizer` launcher was emitted;
  `--add-launcher MCAPRepackApplication=…` was not exercised.
- No interactive UI exercise — pure launch-stability check.

Observations:
- The `installDist` output contained the expected
  `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar` and the full Windows
  classifier jar set (incl. `javafx-*-17.0.8-win.jar`,
  `opencv-…-windows-x86_64.jar`, `openblas-…-windows-x86_64.jar`,
  `ffmpeg-…-windows-x86_64.jar`).
- The exclusion patterns in §3.2(2) above match every non-Windows jar
  cleanly with no false positives.
- `jpackage` produced
  `SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe` (518 KB native launcher) +
  `app/` (156 jars, 327 MB) +
  `runtime/` (bundled JDK).
- The launcher started and the process remained alive for 25+ seconds
  before being killed externally — strong evidence that FXML loading,
  `org.reflections` runtime scanning, JavaFX native lib loading, and
  the OpenCV / FFmpeg / OpenBLAS native bindings all work from inside
  the bundle.

Largest contributors observed in `app/` (Stage 2 candidates if size
becomes a concern):

| Jar | Size |
|---|---|
| `opencv-…-windows-x86_64-gpu.jar` | 138 MB |
| `opencv-…-windows-x86_64.jar` | 33 MB |
| `openblas-…-windows-x86_64.jar` | 29 MB |
| `ffmpeg-…-windows-x86_64.jar` | 26 MB |
| `ihmc-pub-sub-1.2.1.jar` | 16 MB |
| `zstd-jni-1.5.6-3.jar` | 6.7 MB |

The OpenCV CUDA/GPU jar alone is larger than the bundled runtime
saving Stage 2 would deliver; if installer size becomes a hard
constraint it should be evaluated for omission (or split into an
optional download) before further `jlink` tuning.

---

## Stage 2 — `jlink`-trimmed runtime + `jpackage`

Goal: replace the full JRE bundled by Stage 1 with a minimal runtime
image containing only the JDK and JavaFX modules actually used by the
application. The runtime image shrinks from 119 MB to 55 MB on disk
(measured 2026-05-24); the resulting MSI shrinks by ~7 MB after
compression. Stage 2 is the recommended release path.

This stage **does not** require source changes. All third-party
dependencies stay on the classpath (none of them are JPMS-named modules
and adding `module-info.java` to the SCS2 modules is out of scope —
see the Follow-ups section).

The originally projected MSI size of 150–220 MB assumed the JRE
contributed proportionally to the compressed installer. In practice,
the JRE compresses extremely well and the installer is dominated by
already-compressed native-bearing jars (notably
`opencv-…-windows-x86_64-gpu.jar` at 132 MB). Further size reduction
beyond Stage 2 requires culling those native jars, not further `jlink`
trimming — see §2.8 and the Follow-ups section.

### 2.1 Strategy

`jlink` only links explicitly named modules; everything else stays on
classpath. Therefore:

1. Use `jdeps` against the built jars to discover which JDK + JavaFX
   modules the code references.
2. Build a runtime image containing only those modules.
3. Pass that image to `jpackage` via `--runtime-image` instead of
   relying on the default (the running JDK).

### 2.2 JavaFX `jmods`

The JavaFX modules required by the build are pinned at **17.0.8** (see
`scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/build.gradle.kts`). The Maven
`org.openjfx:javafx-*` artifacts shipped to the classpath are **jars**,
not jmods — `jlink` cannot consume them. Download the matching
`openjfx-17.0.8_windows-x64_bin-jmods.zip` from Gluon (see Stage 0.1)
and set:

```bat
set JAVAFX_JMODS_DIR=C:\javafx-jmods-17.0.8
```

### 2.3 Discover required modules with `jdeps`

From the repository root, after running `installDist`:

```bat
jdeps ^
  --module-path "%JAVA_HOME%\jmods;%JAVAFX_JMODS_DIR%" ^
  --multi-release 17 ^
  --ignore-missing-deps ^
  --print-module-deps ^
  --class-path "scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\install\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\lib\*" ^
  scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\install\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\lib\scs2-session-visualizer-jfx-17-0.32.1.jar
```

Record the output. For this codebase it will be a subset of (verify by
running the command — do not hand-edit the list):

```
java.base, java.compiler, java.datatransfer, java.desktop, java.logging,
java.management, java.naming, java.net.http, java.prefs, java.rmi,
java.scripting, java.security.jgss, java.sql, java.xml, jdk.unsupported,
javafx.base, javafx.controls, javafx.fxml, javafx.graphics, javafx.swing
```

`--ignore-missing-deps` is necessary because some third-party jars
(`reflections`, `okhttp`, `gson`) reference optional types that are not
on the classpath; without the flag `jdeps` fails outright.

### 2.4 Build the runtime image

Use the module list discovered in 2.3. The set below is the
conservative baseline known to cover this codebase's runtime needs and
includes a few modules that `jdeps --print-module-deps` may not
surface but the app touches indirectly (HTTPS, secure random, common
charsets):

```bat
jlink ^
  --module-path "%JAVA_HOME%\jmods" ^
  --add-modules java.base,java.compiler,java.datatransfer,java.desktop,java.logging,java.management,java.naming,java.net.http,java.prefs,java.rmi,java.scripting,java.security.jgss,java.sql,java.xml,jdk.crypto.cryptoki,jdk.crypto.ec,jdk.localedata,jdk.unsupported,jdk.unsupported.desktop,jdk.zipfs ^
  --strip-debug ^
  --no-man-pages ^
  --no-header-files ^
  --compress=2 ^
  --include-locales=en ^
  --output scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\jlink-runtime
```

Notes on module choices specific to this codebase:
- **JavaFX modules are intentionally omitted** from the runtime image.
  IHMC's distribution patches `javafx.scene.chart` by shipping
  `FastAxisBase` (and related classes) inside a classpath jar
  (`ihmc-javafx-extensions`). If `javafx.controls`/`javafx.graphics`
  are baked into the boot module layer, the JVM gives those named
  modules ownership of the `javafx.scene.chart` package and the
  classpath patch is rejected at link time:
  `NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/scene/chart/FastAxisBase` is thrown
  the first time a chart is instantiated. The full JavaFX 17.0.8
  runtime — classes **and** native DLLs — ships as classpath jars
  (`javafx-base-17.0.8-win.jar`, `javafx-graphics-17.0.8-win.jar`,
  etc.) already produced by `installDistWindows`, so removing them
  from `jlink` does not lose any functionality.
  As a side benefit, `JAVAFX_JMODS_DIR` is no longer required to
  build the trimmed runtime.
- `jdk.crypto.ec` and `jdk.crypto.cryptoki` are required for HTTPS used
  by the version-check feature (`okhttp` calling out to GitHub). Without
  them the version check fails silently on the first run.
- `jdk.localedata` keeps non-en-US locale data available; if you set
  `--include-locales=en` you can omit this to save ~10 MB.
- `jdk.unsupported` is required because some IHMC native-buffer code
  uses `sun.misc.Unsafe`.
- `jdk.unsupported.desktop` is required by JavaFX Swing interop
  (`SwingNode`).
- `jdk.zipfs` registers the `"jar"`/`"zip"` `FileSystemProvider`.
  `YoGraphicFXResourceManager` enumerates icon resources via
  `FileSystems.newFileSystem(URI.create("jar:..."))`; without this
  module the app fails its first JavaFX-thread initialisation with
  `ProviderNotFoundException: Provider "jar" not found` and the
  primary window never appears.
- `java.scripting` is included defensively — some `gson` reflection
  paths probe for `javax.script` types.

After running, verify the runtime works as a standalone JDK image:

```bat
scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\jlink-runtime\bin\java.exe -version
```

### 2.5 `jpackage` invocations using the trimmed runtime

The Stage 1 invocations are reused **verbatim** with one added argument:

```
--runtime-image scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\build\jlink-runtime
```

inserted before `--add-launcher`. Direct the output to a different
folder so Stage 1 and Stage 2 builds can coexist for comparison:

- `--dest scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\app-image-jlink`
- `--dest scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\msi-jlink`

### 2.6 Stage 2 validation checklist

Repeat every check from Stage 1.5. In addition:

1. **Compare size**:
   ```bat
   dir /s /-c scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\app-image
   dir /s /-c scs2-session-visualizer-jfx\deployment\windows\app-image-jlink
   ```
   The `-jlink` `app-image` should be ~60 MB smaller on disk
   (the runtime portion drops from ~119 MB to ~55 MB). The MSI gain is
   smaller (~7 MB on the measured 0.32.1 build) because the JRE
   compresses very well and the installer is dominated by jars.
2. **HTTPS feature**: trigger the version-check (Help → Check for
   updates, or whatever menu item invokes
   `okhttp` against GitHub). It must complete without an SSL handshake
   error. If it fails, `jdk.crypto.ec` was omitted from `--add-modules`.
3. **Swing interop**: any dialog that hosts AWT/Swing content (e.g. JFR
   thumbnail rendering paths via `SwingNode`) must render correctly.
   Failures indicate `jdk.unsupported.desktop` is missing.
4. **3D scene**: load a session with meshes. The Prism pipeline must
   pick the D3D backend — failure here usually indicates a missing
   JavaFX native DLL, not a `jlink` problem (i.e. the classifier jars
   were stripped).

### 2.7 Stage 2 troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `Module java.base not found` | `%JAVA_HOME%\jmods` missing. JRE-only installations don't ship jmods — install the JDK. |
| `NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/scene/chart/FastAxisBase` on first chart instantiation, primary window never opens | `javafx.*` modules were added to `jlink`. IHMC patches `javafx.scene.chart` from a classpath jar; baking JavaFX into the boot layer creates a split-package conflict the JVM rejects. Remove every `javafx.*` entry from `--add-modules` and let `installDistWindows` provide JavaFX on the classpath (`javafx-*-17.0.8-win.jar`). |
| SSL handshake failures after install | Missing `jdk.crypto.ec` (or `jdk.crypto.cryptoki` for some endpoints) — add and rebuild. |
| `NoClassDefFoundError: sun.misc.Unsafe` | Missing `jdk.unsupported`. |
| `IllegalAccessError` from JavaFX Swing interop | Missing `jdk.unsupported.desktop`. |
| `ProviderNotFoundException: Provider "jar" not found` on startup, primary window never opens | Missing `jdk.zipfs`. Service-loader-only module, not auto-resolved by `jdeps`. |
| Time-zone or formatting errors for non-en-US locales | Drop `--include-locales=en` (or expand it to the needed locales) and add `jdk.localedata`. |
| App still huge after jlink | Most of the bulk is in third-party jars (~80 MB) and native DLLs (`ihmc-video-codecs`, JavaFX Prism), not the runtime. Stage 2 reduces only the JRE portion. |


### 2.8 Stage 2 measurement (2026-05-24)

Measured on the first end-to-end Stage 2 build (Temurin
17.0.19+10 + JavaFX 17.0.8 jmods, project version `17-0.32.1`):

| Artifact | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 2 + no-GPU + no-JavaFX-jmods | Δ vs. Stage 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `jlink` runtime image (on disk) | n/a (full JRE: 118.7 MB) | 54.8 MB | 41.3 MB | −77 MB |
| `app/` (project jars, no GPU) | 312.4 MB | 312.4 MB | 180.1 MB | −132 MB |
| `app-image\SCS2SessionVisualizer\` total (on disk) | 432.0 MB | 368.0 MB | 226.1 MB | −206 MB |
| `.msi` (compressed) | 347.3 MB | 340.2 MB | **204.8 MB** | **−142 MB (−41%)** |

The cumulative final-stage drop (340.2 MB → 204.8 MB) combines two
independent reductions:
- `-PexcludeOpenCvGpu=true` strips the 132 MB CUDA OpenCV jar from
  `app/` (§2.8 follow-up).
- Removing the `javafx.*` modules from `--add-modules` (forced by
  the `FastAxisBase` split-package fix, §2.7) shrinks the `jlink`
  runtime from 54.8 MB to 41.3 MB — JavaFX classes were already on
  the classpath, so they were being shipped twice.

Why the runtime-only MSI gain is small: jpackage already trims the
bundled JDK to ~119 MB in Stage 1 (it does not ship the full ~280 MB
JDK install). The remaining 64 MB the `jlink` runtime saves on disk
compresses to ~7 MB inside the MSI because the JRE is high-entropy
compressible content. The `app/` portion (312 MB of jars) is
essentially incompressible inside an MSI — most jar entries are
already deflated.

The five largest contributors in `app/` (uncompressed) are all
native-bearing jars:

| Jar | Size |
|---|---|
| `opencv-4.10.0-1.5.11-20260107-ihmc-windows-x86_64-gpu.jar` | 132.3 MB |
| `opencv-4.10.0-1.5.11-20260107-ihmc-windows-x86_64.jar` | 31.1 MB |
| `openblas-0.3.28-1.5.11-windows-x86_64.jar` | 27.6 MB |
| `ffmpeg-7.1-1.5.11-windows-x86_64.jar` | 24.4 MB |
| `ihmc-pub-sub-1.2.1.jar` | 15.4 MB |

Further MSI reduction beyond Stage 2 must target these jars (see
Follow-ups). Only one SCS2 source file — `ZEDSVOVideoDataReader` —
references OpenCV at runtime, and it uses the CPU `opencv_core` API
exclusively. The CUDA-enabled `…-windows-x86_64-gpu.jar` is pulled in
transitively by `ihmc-robot-data-logger → us.ihmc:opencv (+ natives)`
and is a candidate for removal pending a runtime test against a ZED
SVO recording.

An opt-in Gradle property `-PexcludeOpenCvGpu=true` extends the
`installDistWindows` exclusion filter to drop the GPU classifier jar.
The default is unchanged (the jar ships).

**Decision (2026-05-24): the default stays `false`.** The Stage 2 MSI
without the GPU exclusion is ~340 MB compressed / ~209 MB installed,
which was accepted as the working baseline. Flipping the default
would require validating against a real ZED SVO log on a machine
with the ZED SDK installed (`ZEDSVOScrubber` silently skips SVO files
when the SDK native is absent), and no such validation has been done.
Static analysis still indicates the flip is safe — the only SCS2
source file that imports OpenCV is `ZEDSVOVideoDataReader`, which
uses the CPU `opencv_core` API exclusively, and no source file
references `opencv_cuda*` — but until a ZED-bearing log has been
played back end-to-end against a `-PexcludeOpenCvGpu=true` build,
the opt-in flag is the safer ergonomic. Builders who want the
smaller MSI can pass the flag explicitly; nothing else changes.

## Stage 3 — Gradle integration

Goal: encapsulate the manual `jpackage`/`jlink` invocations of Stages 1
and 2 into Gradle tasks in
`scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/build.gradle.kts`, mirroring the existing
`installDistLinux` and `buildDebianPackage` task style. The result is
reproducible from a single Gradle invocation and survives version
bumps without manual edits.

### 3.1 Task design

Add the following tasks (specification, not source — actual source
goes in the build script):

| Task name | Depends on | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `installDistWindows` | `installDist` | Copy `installDist` output to a clean staging dir, dropping non-Windows native classifier jars (parallels `installDistLinux`). |
| `buildJlinkRuntime` | `installDistWindows` | Run `jlink` to produce `build/jlink-runtime`. Inputs: classpath jars + `JAVAFX_JMODS_DIR` system property. |
| `packageWindowsAppImage` | `installDistWindows` | Run `jpackage --type app-image`. Stage 1 deliverable. |
| `packageWindowsAppImageJlink` | `installDistWindows`, `buildJlinkRuntime` | Run `jpackage --type app-image --runtime-image …`. Stage 2 deliverable. |
| `packageWindowsMsi` | `installDistWindows` | Run `jpackage --type msi`. Stage 1 deliverable. |
| `packageWindowsMsiJlink` | `installDistWindows`, `buildJlinkRuntime` | Run `jpackage --type msi --runtime-image …`. Stage 2 deliverable. |
| `buildWindowsPackages` | `packageWindowsAppImage`, `packageWindowsMsi` | Convenience aggregator. |
| `buildWindowsPackagesJlink` | `packageWindowsAppImageJlink`, `packageWindowsMsiJlink` | Convenience aggregator. |

All tasks should be **OS-guarded**: skip with an explanatory message if
`!Os.isFamily(Os.FAMILY_WINDOWS)`, the same way `buildDebianPackage`
checks `Os.FAMILY_UNIX`.

### 3.2 Build-script additions (specification)

The implementation follows the patterns already used for the Linux
flow. Specification details:

1. **Top-level constants** (next to the existing
   `sessionVisualizerExecutableName`):
   ```kotlin
   val windowsUpgradeUuid = "f74c546b-1d1d-4114-9812-809b8eb1412c"
   val windowsInstallerVersion = ihmc.version.replace("-", ".")
   val windowsDeploymentRoot = "${project.projectDir}/deployment/windows"
   val jlinkRuntimeDir = "${project.buildDir}/jlink-runtime"
   ```
   The `windowsUpgradeUuid` value above is the product's canonical
   stable UUID. Do not regenerate or change it between releases — doing
   so breaks in-place upgrades for users who installed previous
   versions.

2. **`installDistWindows`**: copies `build/install/scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/`
   into `$windowsDeploymentRoot/staging/`, then deletes non-Windows
   classifier jars from `lib/`. Use these include patterns (verified
   against the actual `installDist` output on 2026-05-24):
   ```
   include("*-linux-*")     // ffmpeg-*-linux-x86_64.jar, opencv-*-linux-*.jar, netty-*-linux-*.jar
   include("*-linux.jar")   // javafx-base-17.0.8-linux.jar (no trailing classifier segment)
   include("*-android-*")
   include("*-ios-*")
   include("*-macos-*")     // netty-resolver-dns-*-macos-*.jar
   include("*-osx-*")       // *-osx-aarch_64.jar, *-osx-x86_64.jar
   ```
   This mirrors `installDistLinux` but with the opposite platform set.
   Note that the existing `installDistLinux` uses `*-macosx-*`, which
   does **not** match the `-macos-` jars actually present; that is a
   pre-existing minor bug in the Linux path that is out of scope here
   but is fixed in the Windows path above.

3. **`buildJlinkRuntime`**: reads `JAVAFX_JMODS_DIR` from the project
   property of the same name (set via `-PJAVAFX_JMODS_DIR=…` or
   `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`). Fails fast if unset. Executes the
   exact `jlink` invocation from Stage 2.4 via
   `ihmc.exec(ProcessBuilder(…))`.

4. **`packageWindowsAppImage` / `packageWindowsMsi`**: build the
   `jpackage` argument list dynamically. The two tasks share 90% of
   their arguments; factor into a Kotlin helper function
   `fun jpackageArgsCommon(type: String, dest: String): List<String>`.
   The MSI task appends `--win-dir-chooser --win-menu …`. The MCAP
   launcher property file is materialised into
   `$windowsDeploymentRoot/launchers/MCAPRepackApplication.properties`
   at task-execution time with the correct main-jar name substituted
   from `ihmc.version`, the same way `buildDebianPackage` writes
   `control` and `*.desktop` files.

5. **`packageWindowsAppImageJlink` / `packageWindowsMsiJlink`**: same
   as above but with `--runtime-image $jlinkRuntimeDir` appended and
   `--dest` pointing at `app-image-jlink` / `msi-jlink`.

6. **JDK toolchain assertion**: at task-configuration time, fail if
   `JavaVersion.current() < JavaVersion.VERSION_17` to give a clear
   message instead of an obscure `jpackage` error.

7. **Caching**: declare task inputs and outputs explicitly so Gradle
   skips rebuilds when nothing changed:
   - Inputs: the `lib/` directory contents, `scs-icon.ico`, the
     `MCAPRepackApplication.properties` template, `ihmc.version`.
   - Outputs: the per-task `--dest` directory.

8. **OS guard**: every task's `doFirst { … }` checks
   `Os.isFamily(Os.FAMILY_WINDOWS)` and throws
   `GradleException("Windows packaging tasks only run on Windows.")`
   otherwise.

### 3.3 Invocation examples

After the build script is updated:

```bat
gradlew.bat :scs2-session-visualizer-jfx:buildWindowsPackages
```

Builds both Stage 1 deliverables (`app-image` folder + `.msi`).

```bat
gradlew.bat :scs2-session-visualizer-jfx:buildWindowsPackagesJlink ^
            -PJAVAFX_JMODS_DIR=C:\javafx-jmods-17.0.8
```

Builds both Stage 2 deliverables.

### 3.4 Update `docs/Making-a-release.md`

The release procedure invokes `buildWindowsPackagesJlink` (Stage 2) as
the default Windows packaging target. The `.msi` for upload is taken
from `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx/deployment/windows/msi-jlink/`. The
Stage 1 task `buildWindowsPackages` is retained as a fallback for
machines without the JavaFX jmods download.

## End-to-end validation matrix

Run after every release-candidate build, on a clean Windows 10 or 11
machine that does **not** have a JDK installed (to verify the bundled
runtime is sufficient):

| Check | Stage 1 | Stage 2 |
|---|---|---|
| `SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe` launches without console | ✓ | ✓ |
| Main window shows SCS icon, "No Active Session" title | ✓ | ✓ |
| Open MCAP log session | ✓ | ✓ |
| Open YoVariable log session | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3D scene renders (D3D pipeline) | ✓ | ✓ |
| YoGraphic editor dropdown is populated | ✓ | ✓ |
| Load URDF robot model | ✓ | ✓ |
| Load SDF robot model | ✓ | ✓ |
| `MCAPRepackApplication.exe --help` prints help to console | ✓ | ✓ |
| `MCAPRepackApplication.exe` with no args opens file chooser | ✓ | ✓ |
| Remote session connect (data server discovery) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Version check against GitHub (HTTPS) | ✓ | ✓ (verifies `jdk.crypto.ec`) |
| Start Menu + desktop shortcut work | MSI only | MSI only |
| Upgrade install replaces previous version | MSI only | MSI only |
| Uninstall removes program files | MSI only | MSI only |
| Bundle size in line with §2.8 measurement | ~347 MB MSI | ~340 MB MSI |

## Follow-ups (out of scope for this plan)

These items are noted explicitly so they are not forgotten, but are
**not** part of the initial Windows-executable work:

1. **Code signing.** Sign `SCS2SessionVisualizer.exe`,
   `MCAPRepackApplication.exe`, and the `.msi` with an Authenticode
   certificate using `signtool.exe`. This eliminates the Windows
   SmartScreen warning. Requires:
   - An EV or OV code-signing certificate.
   - `signtool.exe` from the Windows SDK on `PATH`.
   - A new Gradle task `signWindowsArtifacts` that runs after the
     packaging tasks and before any upload step.
   - A secure mechanism for the certificate (HSM / smart card /
     Azure Key Vault).

2. **CI automation.** Extend
   `.github/workflows/main-gradleCI-build.yml` (or add a new release
   workflow) with a `windows-latest` job that:
   - Checks out the tag.
   - Sets up Temurin 17 via `actions/setup-java`.
   - Downloads JavaFX 17.0.8 jmods from Gluon.
   - Installs WiX 3.x.
   - Runs `gradlew.bat :scs2-session-visualizer-jfx:buildWindowsPackagesJlink`.
   - Uploads the `.msi` as a release asset using
     `softprops/action-gh-release`.
   Note that the existing CI workflow only runs tests on Ubuntu;
   release packaging is currently manual on all platforms.

3. **ARM64 (Windows on ARM).** Currently out of scope because:
   - JavaFX 17.0.8 does not ship Windows ARM64 native libraries.
   - The IHMC native dependencies (`ihmc-video-codecs`) likely lack
     ARM64 builds.
   Revisit when JavaFX 21+ adoption and IHMC native rebuilds catch up.

4. **Full JPMS modularisation.** Adding `module-info.java` to
   `scs2-definition`, `scs2-session`, `scs2-session-visualizer`, and
   `scs2-session-visualizer-jfx` would allow `jlink` to bundle the
   application itself into the runtime image, dropping size by another
   30–50 MB. Substantial effort because every transitive automatic
   module would need either real `module-info.java` files upstream or
   `--add-reads ALL-UNNAMED` shims.

5. **Auto-update.** None of `jpackage` outputs include an update
   mechanism. If autoupdate becomes a requirement, options are:
   - Bake the existing version-check feature into a self-updating
     wrapper.
   - Re-evaluate alternative installer frameworks (Squirrel.Windows,
     install4j) that provide update infrastructure.

6. **Per-launcher icons.** `MCAPRepackApplication.exe` currently reuses
   the main SCS icon. Add a dedicated MCAP `.ico` and reference it via
   the launcher properties file if differentiation is desired.

7. **`.exe` installer via Inno Setup.** WiX 3.x is sufficient for the
   stated needs. If a non-elevated per-user installer is later
   required, add Inno Setup 6 as an alternative `--type exe` path.
